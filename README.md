- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m  Ellie (@l0e42)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in theoretical computer science and mathematical foundations. I like set theory, automata theory, proof theory, graph theory, finite model theory 
and lots of other things. I also like algorithms and complexity, especialy when paired with the above, and even more when there are graphs involved. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently doing PhD at Reykjavik University on Theoretical Computer Science, which i am plannig to finish by the end of summer in 2022. 
- :) Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on multi-trace runtime monitoring, epistemic temporal logic, rewritting rules fo CCS and implementing some of the applications of
these works.
