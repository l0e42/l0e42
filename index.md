# About me 

* 👋 Hi, I’m  Ellie (@l0e42)
* 👀 I’m interested in theoretical computer science and mathematical foundations. I like set theory, automata theory, proof theory, graph theory, finite model theory 
and lots of other things. I also like algorithms and complexity, especialy when paired with the above, and even more when there are graphs involved. 
* 🌱 I’m currently doing PhD at Reykjavik University on Theoretical Computer Science, which i am plannig to finish by the end of summer in 2022. 
* :) I’m looking to collaborate on multi-trace runtime monitoring, epistemic temporal logic, rewritting rules fo CCS and implementing some of the applications of
these works. 
* 📫 How to reach me: <name without last e ~~no spaces~~ the number after 18> at ru.is

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
